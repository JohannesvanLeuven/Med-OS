# pyusbusÂ Readme

## Objective

The objective for this lib is be able to get images from USB probes easily, under python, in a user-friendly API, getting images in 3 lines of code.

```python
import pyusbus as usbProbe
probe = usbProbe.HealsonUP20() 
frames = probe.getImages(n=50) # should give you a loop of 50 frames
```

## Result

![](/experiments/images/first.gif)

## Installation

You can use the `build.sh` and `install.sh` scripts to prepare your module. Hopefully soon to come under pip.

# General setup
 
Need to work on the documentation here.

## Ubuntu adjustements

```
sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"04B4\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"8613\", MODE=\"666\"">/etc/udev/rules.d/99-healson.rules 
```

# Contents

* the `experiments` folder contains .. experiments.
  * [Initial Jupyter notebook](/experiments/20210325-InitialTest.ipynb)
